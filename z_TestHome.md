# The Home Page
Welcome to the Home Page of setting up your Pokemon automation. 

First order of business is understanding how far into automation you will need to go for what you want to do. The chart below is a simplification of what setup to choose based on the game. The automation level is set by what the majority of types of programs any given game has.

| Game | Automation Level |
| --- | --- |
| Scarlet & Violet | Computer Controlled | 
| Legends of Arceus | Computer Controlled |
| Brilliant Diamond & Shining Pearl | Computer Controlled |
| Sword & Shield | Microcontroller |
| Sowrd & Shield DLC | Computer Controlled |

> For a full list of programs go here for [Microcontroller](https://github.com/PokemonAutomation/Microcontroller/blob/master/Wiki/Programs/README.md) and here for [Computer Controlled](https://github.com/PokemonAutomation/ComputerControl/tree/master/Wiki/Programs).

# [Step 1] Buy Hardware

**No matter the level of automation you need, start here!**
If you are  

> _Buy the necessary items from 1.A & 1.B._

## Microcontroller (MC) Hardware Options

###  Step 1.A - Buy hardware under the column of what type of Switch you have.

> | Switch | Switch Lite |
> | --- | --- |
> | Mini-USB male to USB-A male cable or adapter. ([example 0](https://www.amazon.com/Cmple-Pack-Male-5-Pin-Adapter/dp/B084RN3Z3S?th=1), [example 1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00P0GI68M)) | Mini-USB male to USB-A male cable or adapter. ([example](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07QJTX59H/)) |
> |     | A USB hub or portable dock. ([example](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07JK9DFKH)) |

### Step 1.B - Buy *one* of the following Microcontrollers.
> 
> Select which column best exemplifies your experience and purchase that microcontroller.
> 
> | [Arduino Leonardo](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0786LJQ8K) | [Teensy2.0](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy.html) / [Teensy2.0++](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensypp.html) | [Pro Micro](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08BJNV1J3) |
> | --- | --- | --- | 
> | For beginners | For beginners | Experienced users |
> | I am accustomed to Arduino | I want to easily add programs | I want to automate multiple switches, cheaply |
> | I'm not experienced with electronics | I'm not experienced with electronics | I know my way around electronics |

### Step 1.C - Verify you have the following

> 1. A Mini-USB male to USB-A male cable or adapter (from Step 1.A)
> 2. A USB hub or portable dock (from Step 1.A **only** if you have a Switch Lite!)
> 3. A microcontroller (from Step 1.B)

## Computer Controlled (CC) Hardware Options

Skipp these steps if you are only doing the Microcontroller setup.

> _Buy the necessary items from 1.D, 1.E, 1.F, and 1.G._
