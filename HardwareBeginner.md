# **PART 2**

This is the second step in the process towards automation!

# (1) Select how far into automation you want to get

**No matter the level of automation you need, start here!**

Select your level of automation 

| [Microcontroller](HardwareBeginner.md#2-microcontroller-hardware) | [Computer Controlled](HardwareBeginner.md#2-microcontroller-hardware) |
| --- | --- |
| Basic SwSh Den hosting | All microcontroller programs plus... | 
| SwSh Day Skipping | Automated Dynamax Adventures! |
| SwSh Egg Hatchers | Den Hosting with stats!  |
| Unattended SwSh Shiny Hunts | Autonomous SwSh & BDSP Shiny Hunts! |

*The levels of automation build off each other, to do Auto Max Lair you have to proceed trhough Microcontroller and Computer Controlled tutorials. You have been warned.*
**Please note that the BDSP programs are still new. The majority of programs are for SwSh.

# (2) Microcontroller Hardware

_Buy the following items below._

1. [Arduino Leonardo Board](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0786LJQ8K)

If it doesn't come with the cable, you will need it separately. It is a Micro-USB male to USB-A cable.

**Switch Lite users will also need:**

2. A USB hub or portable dock. ([example](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07JK9DFKH))

> The Switch Lite does not have a USB-A port. Therefore you need either an adapter or a hub to connect the ProMicro. A charging hub or dock is required to simultaneously charge and use the ProMicro.
> 
> Portable docks will work for the Switch Lite, but will not be able to output video over the HDMI.

**Verify you have the following**

1. An Arduino **Leonardo** (from step (2)A)
2. A USB hub or portable dock (if you have a Switch Lite!)

If you are doing Computer Controlled or Auto Max Lair automation, proceed below to buy more hardware.

# (3) Additional Hardware for Computer Control Automation

_Buy the necessary items from A, B, C, & D._

**A.** [Adafruit UART](https://www.adafruit.com/product/954)

**B.** [Mini-Grabbers to Male Jumer Wires](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08M5GNY47)

**C.** Purchase a Video capture card ([example](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B088HBRM7T))

> Most cheap capture cards work. Higher end-capture cards may cause issues with color detection.

**D.** HDMI Cables (if you don't own any)

***Important:** You will need a fairly powerful computer to handle serial programs with video feedback. For a single Switch with video feedback, we recommend a quad core computer no older than 2015. If you want to run 4 Switches all with feedback, we recommend a modern 8-core computer. The computer must also be running 64-bit Windows, though plan to extend support to other operating systems in the future.*

> There are many ways to set this up with varying cost and difficulty. Here we will present some simple options that do not require soldering. If you are experienced with electronics, feel free to do your own thing.
